# terdon's answer is correct in most cases, but for distributions that have adopted systemd-logind it handles power events instead of acpid. On those distributions, add or edit this setting 
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/logind.conf
# to disable the power button:

HandlePowerKey=ignore

#To pick up the new setting, restart logind with

sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind

# On some older distributions logind can't be restarted while a desktop session is active, in which case you'll need to reboot in order to pick up the new setting.
